Release notes

In general: update them just before setting a tag:
git tag -a vx.y.z

Describe the changes (the motivation) which motiviated this tag.
The same information should be added into this file, so that
the tag has the "diff" of ReleaseNotes.txt, kind of.

It is probably a good idea to set a new tag with every new feature.
The first digit should be increased, when there are non compatible changes:
  Things had been removed, code that had been moved inside the code tree,
  so that a project will not compile without further changes.
The second digit will be inccreased when a new feature had been added,
which will reset the third digit to 0.
(The word digit is wrong. We can have 2.11.13 or so)

The 3rd digit will be increased, when there is a pure bugfix.
See v2.0.0 vs 2.0.1

v2.4.0
- Improvements:
  - Pneumatic axis code was changed to OOP style, with methods instead of actions (MBP-229).
- New features:
  - A bool variable was added in the stConfig to prevent going full speed to a limit switch 
    when comissioning (MBP-253)
  - Pneumatic axis has a bool variable to configure if it is a safety shutter or not (MBP-274).

v2.3.0
- Improvements:
  - Homing configuration is extended to be able to select between 
    falling and rising edge and type of sensor, see MBP-232
  - Integrate the motor temperature monitoring as part of FB_Axis and delete
    the temperature monitoring FB, see MBP-259
- New features:
  - Add in the VISU the bMoving status, the temperature value and the status
    of the High Temperature disabled bit, see MBP-265
  - Add the ReleaseNotes.txt file
- Bug fix:
  - Fix error not propagating when moving an axis and disabling the power 
    during movement. Now the status ID and error bit are propagated, see MBP-260
  - Delete extra directory VISUs_Org

v2.2.0
- Improvements:
  - Home direct as default homing routine. bHomed is set to TRUE,
    see MBP-255
  - Add the description fields in Axis_template
    see MBP-208: implement new description structure
- New features:
  - MBP-233: motor temperature monitoring FB
- Notes:
  git show v2.2.0 says that See MBP-214 is part of this version,
  but it is part of v2.1.0

v2.1.0
- New feature:
    Make it possible Change velocity and position on the fly
    See MBP-214
- Cleanup:
    Delete extra ST_AxisError. Keep the one under DUT/Axis_Structures
    Set the ouput of DC voltage monitoring  to TRUE as default value

v2.0.2
  Support automated testing of different versions better:
  Add a version string, and set it to 2.0.2


v2.0.1
  Fix a bug when eHomeDirect never set the bDone bit

v2.0.0
- Various improvements for the pneumatics
- OOP implementation of FB_Axis
- MBP-202 new slit code ess rev
- Add persistent variable for encoder position BIAS
- Remove Jog from eMotionCommands and all the refrences of it
- Add bInTargetPosition variable to ST_AxisStatus
- Remove all LineIDs; Add scripts for bitbucket pipelines
- Add a filter/ directory to clean up whitespace and more
- InVelocity in status array
- MBP-222: Homing through StepBlockDetection
 Known issue:
   Done stays FALSE when doing a "home direct"
