Release notes

In general: update them just before setting a tag:
git tag -a vx.y.z

Describe the changes (the motivation) which motiviated this tag.
The same information should be added into this file, so that
the tag has the "diff" of ReleaseNotes.txt, kind of.

It is probably a good idea to set a new tag with every new feature.
The first digit should be increased, when there are non compatible changes:
  Things had been removed, code that had been moved inside the code tree,
  so that a project will not compile without further changes.
The second digit will be inccreased when a new feature had been added,
which will reset the third digit to 0.
(The word digit is wrong. We can have 2.11.13 or so)

The 3rd digit will be increased, when there is a pure bugfix.
See v2.0.0 vs 2.0.1

v2.9.0
- New features:
  - FB_Monitoring for all cabinet types at ESS (MBP-312).
  - Add code to handle the temperature sensor hystersis. The motor will be disabled if the temperature
	surpasses the defined Max Temperature, and it will not be able to be enabled until the value is
	5 degrees less than the defined Max temperature (MBP-314).
- Bug fix:
  - Increase the initialization timer in FB_PneumaticAxis to avoid starting in error. Due
    to the dealy between the Outpust for powering the swithces and running the PLC program
	the Pneumatic axis used to start in error state because the Bwd limit switch was not found.
  - Delete unused stranded grey box in the far right hand side of the MAIN Visu. This was discovered 
    when scaling the MAIN Visu to be used in a web browser.
  - In MAIN Visu correct the link of the HWMaskActive button. It was wrongly linked to the bLocalMode (MBP-316).
  - Fix Homing bug, homing sequences did not start if axis was on a limit switch. All homing works now
    even if the axis is on the limit switch (MBP-321).

v2.8.0
- New features:
  - Add buttons in MainVisu to enable and disable the soft limits (MBP-301).
  - Cabinet monitoring for MCU5001a (MBP-495).
  - Pneumatics
    - Add two pressure sensor groups to reflect the configuration of the pneumatic 
	  boxes (MBP-303).
	- Closing (turning valve off) has priority. You can close at any point and that 
	  command will take over. 
- Improvements:
  - Pneumatics
    - Now the pressure limits are per pressure group and based on application. The limits were
	  moved to GVL_APP.
	- The timer for closing and opening now starts when the command is sent instead of when 
	  the axis starts moving.
	- Remove the variable bAirpressurePower from the st_outputs of the pneumatics axis. It will be
      included in the Pneumatic_Box PROG in the application specific section (MBP-310).
	- Remove bPSSPermit from the st_input. Use the bPSSPermitOK from st_status for the checks. 
	  The actual PSS permit signals wre moved to the Safey_Shutter program (MBP-310).
	- In GVL delete the initial value of iPneumaticAxis. We are setting it to 1 in the MAIN/AXES (MBP-310).
	- The variable stPneumaticAxisConfig.nAllowTimePressureOutOfRange will be moved to GVL_APP as 
	  tTIME_PRESSURE_OUT_OF_RANGE: TIME := T#10S and link to the pneumatic axis in Pneumatics_template (MBP-310).
	- Update GlobalTextList: Fix typos and delete unused items.
- Bug fix:
  - Fix pneumatics starting displaying no State.
  - Fix when closing while Opening, it went to Error State.
  - Remove any GVL_APP variables inside the FB_PneumaticAxis so it can build without errors without 
    the need of the correct tc_generic_structure variables (MBP-310).
  - Link bLocalMode and bHWMaskActive button in MainVisu to the corresponding GVL variable. 

v2.7.0
- New features:
  - Backlash compensation: https://confluence.ess.eu/display/MCAG/Backlash+compensation (MBP-167).
  - Homing with two speeds (towards and from CAM) is the new default and only way of homing.
    This fixes the homing bug of bouncing against the limit non-stop (MBP-269, MBP-279, MBP-288).
  - Add two status variables for detecting low and high pressure in FB_PneumaticAxis (MBP-297).
  - Read and Write CoE parameters to a Beckhoff motor drive (MBP-271).
  - Improved comments for code and variables (MBP-257).
- Bug fix:
  - Remove Warnings created by the VAR_IN_OUT in the FB_PneumaticAxis. Instead of VAR_IN_OUT
    it was changed to be handled as a reference like in FB_Axis (MBP-292).
  - Remove unused bJogFwd and bJogBwd commands from ST_AxisControl (MBP-296).
  - Remove unused variable fRampVelocity from ST_BacklashConfig (MBP-300).

v2.6.0
- New features:
  - Add button in MainVisu to control the variable bEnableStopWithAnyLimitSwitch (MBP-280).
- Bug fix:
  - Fix bug in MainVisu that did not showed the properties of the Visu elements.

v2.5.0
- New features:
  - Autoreset the errors of pneumatic axes when they dissapear (MBP-276).
  - Remove from all files the version number. That version number was not 
    related to the TwinCAT version in a documented way (MBP-286).
- Bug fix:
  - Fix elements of MainVisu pointing to an non-existing variable in the
    configuration "On mouse click" (MBP-287).
  - Remove from the Jog buttons in VISU a call for an empty script on the
    "on Mouse click" configuration.

v2.4.0
- Improvements:
  - Pneumatic axis code was changed to OOP style, with methods instead of actions (MBP-229).
- New features:
  - A bool variable was added in the stConfig to prevent going full speed to a limit switch 
    when comissioning (MBP-253)
  - Pneumatic axis has a bool variable to configure if it is a safety shutter or not (MBP-274).

v2.3.0
- Improvements:
  - Homing configuration is extended to be able to select between 
    falling and rising edge and type of sensor, see MBP-232
  - Integrate the motor temperature monitoring as part of FB_Axis and delete
    the temperature monitoring FB, see MBP-259
- New features:
  - Add in the VISU the bMoving status, the temperature value and the status
    of the High Temperature disabled bit, see MBP-265
  - Add the ReleaseNotes.txt file
- Bug fix:
  - Fix error not propagating when moving an axis and disabling the power 
    during movement. Now the status ID and error bit are propagated, see MBP-260
  - Delete extra directory VISUs_Org

v2.2.0
- Improvements:
  - Home direct as default homing routine. bHomed is set to TRUE,
    see MBP-255
  - Add the description fields in Axis_template
    see MBP-208: implement new description structure
- New features:
  - MBP-233: motor temperature monitoring FB
- Notes:
  git show v2.2.0 says that See MBP-214 is part of this version,
  but it is part of v2.1.0

v2.1.0
- New feature:
    Make it possible Change velocity and position on the fly
    See MBP-214
- Cleanup:
    Delete extra ST_AxisError. Keep the one under DUT/Axis_Structures
    Set the ouput of DC voltage monitoring  to TRUE as default value

v2.0.2
  Support automated testing of different versions better:
  Add a version string, and set it to 2.0.2


v2.0.1
  Fix a bug when eHomeDirect never set the bDone bit

v2.0.0
